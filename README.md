This is a game made with Pygame wherein you must care for a pigeon. I'm having a lot of fun making this and it's currently a work in progress. To run the game, run "pigeongamecode.py" or "mainloop.py" (this isn't as far on as "pigeongamecode.py"). Preferably, run "pigeongamecode.py" because "mainloop.py" might be a bit buggy.
